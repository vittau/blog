Ok I'll share a secret here: I have a tendency to obsess over little details. A <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/poetsofthefall/stay.html" target="_blank">poet</a> once said "it's the little things that make the world", and this is one of the greatest truths to me.

So let's talk about one of these little things I can obsess about: fonts.

After having spent way more time than I probably should searching for the perfect programming font, I have come up with some candidates. My criteria includes first and foremost readability, but also character proportions, slashed/dotted zeros, l (L) vs I, and yes, even beauty.

One of the first fonts I remember using other than the Windows' default <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas" target="_blank">Consolas</a> was <a href="http://nodnod.net/2009/feb/12/adding-straight-single-and-double-quotes-inconsola/" target="_blank">Inconsolata-dz</a> (a variant of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata" target="_blank">Inconsolata</a>). It is a readable and beautiful font, but one of the little things that annoy me is the width and character spacing, which tends to spread stuff horizontally more than I'd like.

Then I tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_(typeface)" target="_blank">Monaco</a>, a font that ships with macOS (except I put it on Windows). It's a very stylish one, for sure. I used it for quite a while, until I got annoyed by it's, how should I put it, "opinionated" style. I don't know, it's as if it's simply too stylish for a programming font. By the way, check out <a href="http://eurofurence.net/monofur.html" target="_blank">monofur</a> if you DO like your stylish programming fonts.

Then I did try <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro" target="_blank">Source Code Pro</a> for a while, but felt it suffered from the same problem as the Inconsolata family.

I stumbled upon <a href="http://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/">mononoki</a>, an awesome font. I ended up not using it after having <a href="https://github.com/madmalik/mononoki/issues/38#issuecomment-225941213" target="_blank">some problems</a> with JetBrains software, but I still think it's a great font. Readable, good spacing, pleasant to look at.

I believe that's around the time when I found about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature" target="_blank">font ligatures</a>. What it does is merge multiple characters into one, useful to turn stuff like == >= =< that we use all the time into more pleasant-looking glyphs. So, the first ones I tried were <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode" target="_blank">Fira Code</a> and <a href="http://larsenwork.com/monoid/" target="_blank">Monoid</a>. The problem is that, while the ligatures are pretty cool, for some reason I couldn't get myself into liking these fonts' styles.

At this moment I felt like I've seen it all. As if I had mastered the <a href="www.taobackup.com" target="_blank">Tao of Backup</a>, but for fonts. That's when I stumbled upon <a href="http://input.fontbureau.com/" target="_blank">Input</a>. It's a non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font" target="_blank">monospace</a> programming font. The blasphemy, right?! What about our carefully aligned ASCII art? Well, turns out you don't really NEED a monospace font to program. It's not like Sublime Text will yell at you or something. No, really, I promise. While I didn't particularly enjoy Input's look and eventually dropped it, I felt it's a very important turning point for programming font development. You can design a font for programming and having it not be monospaced. I hope we get to see more of these with time...

So, what am I using right now? I'm currently testing this font called <a href="https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/" target="_blank">Iosevka</a>. It's a beautiful and readable font, and a pretty narrow one. Maybe a little bit TOO narrow, but I like it. Currently pairing it with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=idleberg.hopscotch" target="_blank">Hopscotch</a> theme for <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> (Yes, I think it's better than Sublime Text. No, it's not a bloated mess like Visual Studio). I think it's one of the most readable and pleasant-looking combos I've come up with so far.

Well, at least until next week...
