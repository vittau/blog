Back then in the eighties there was this new exciting tech called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI" target="_blank">MIDI</a>. It was the first attempt at a standard for electronic instrument synthesizers. Computers of the time, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X68000" target="_blank">Sharp X68000</a> usually came with some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation_synthesis" target="_blank">FM synthesizer</a> such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2151" target="_blank">Yamaha YM2151</a>, which modulates instrument sounds out of simple waveforms such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave" target="_blank">square wave</a> and changes its timbre by altering the frequency.

Other more expensive devices however, had what's called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavetable_synthesis" target="_blank">wavetable</a>. Wavetables are recordings of the actual instruments, of which many samples were taken and music was modulated by chosing the nearest ones and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation" target="_blank">interpolating</a> between them. One such device is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_MT-32" target="_blank">Roland MT-32</a>, which cost almost US$700 back then in 1987 when it was released.

Are you ready to embark on an exciting adventure into emulation?!

Great! First a little bit of motivation (well, at least my motivation). There was this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up" target="_blank">shmup</a> I used to play in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol-Feace" target="_blank">Sega Genesis</a> called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol-Feace" target="_blank">Sol-Feace</a> (which was actually known as "Sol-Deace" in the Genesis). While reading about the Roland MIDI devices, I found out that one of my favorite games by Wolf Team, now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namco_Tales_Studio" target="_blank">Namco Tales Studio</a>, supported the Roland MT-32 hardware in its Sharp X68000 computer version. I, of course, had to play that.

Work in progress...
