<i><strong>Fair warning: pretentious blog post!</strong></i>

I'm <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=why+is+there+something+instead+of+nothing" target="_blank">not the first one asking this question</a>. Quite possibly one of the oldest questions of mankind, and probably of other species out there as well. It's by no means an easy one to answer, or even think about. What is "nothing", anyway? If you can measure it, it's already "something", and not "nothing". An empty space is "something".

While I have completely given up trying to wrap my head around what "nothing" is, I decided to turn my attention to "something". Is "something" finite? That would be rather odd, because that would imply "something" else outside. Or "nothing". I'm a computer science dude after all, so I'll give you my theory, based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)" target="_blank">information entropy</a>, on why I believe infinite "something" is actually possible and quite plausible.

But first, let me digress a little bit, it should be worthwile for my point. Hopefully.

A couple months ago I had this awesome idea for a compression algorithm. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi" target="_blank">&pi;</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number" target="_blank">transcendental number</a>, probably contains (if it is indeed a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalNumber.html" target="_blank">normal number</a>) every sequence possible encoded on itself. That means the complete works of Shakespeare are stored inside &pi;. Your <a href="http://www.dr-mikes-math-games-for-kids.com/your-name-in-pi.html" target="_blank">name</a> is also in there somewhere. Heck, even your whole DNA. So what if we were to, instead of representing data directly, simply locate and store the index of &pi; where our data is located? That would save us a lot of space, right?! Well, turns out there really is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch" target="_blank">no such thing as a free lunch</a>. Information entropy comes in to politely tell me that the index of &pi; where my data is stored is, on average, just as big as the data itself. \*Sigh\*. By the way, I was <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/42464/are-there-any-compression-algorithms-based-on-pi" target="_blank">not the first weirdo</a> who had this idea in case you're wondering.

Now, think about a sort of a reverse situation: what if I have an infinitely long, completely empty space? What differentiates this space, fron another infinitely long, empty space? An empty space is completely defined by its dimensions, there's no other information contained within it. In this case, my awesome compression algorithm works really well, because I can "compress" an infinite space simply by storing the data which says that it's an empty space with infinite dimensions. I believe that's as close to "nothing" as you can get. Since this is the lowest possible information volume, what if the background of our universe is indeed infinite, as in an infinitely long empty space? A finite amount of information, contained in an infinite background. I'm of course being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle" target="_blank">controversial</a> and assuming a non-homogeneous, non-isotropic universe, because that would imply an infinite universe to have infinite information.

We might never be able to truly answers this question, maybe simply because we don't have access to the necessary scope to answer it (such as if it's indeed the case that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-living-in-a-computer-simulation/" target="_blank">we are living in a simulation</a>).

Well, hopefully this post will make you lose some sleep over this question, just as it does to me.
